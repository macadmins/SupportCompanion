# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.3.1] - 2025-10-06
### Changed
- Refactored the uninstall script with better error handling and logging.

## [2.3.0] - 2025-09-18
### Changed
- Updated UI elements to match the new look introduced in macOS 26 (Tahoe).
- Cards now use the liquid glass effect and updated corner radius to better align with the new design language.
- Moved the dark/light mode toggle and support info button to the top-right toolbar.
- Added reboot reminder notifications, turned off by default and can be enabled using the key `RebootReminderDays`. Example configuration,
```xml
<key>RebootReminderDays</key>
<integer>7</integer>
```
- Minor UI tweaks for cards, removed shadows for text.
- Removed entitlements from helper to reduce attack surface.

## [2.2.2] - 2025-06-13
### Fixed
- Last restart now correctly displays the time since last restart in the correct format when copying device information to the clipboard.

### Added
- A new option to exclude certain folders from log collection. This allows for admins to exclude certain folders from being collected when the user runs the log collection action. This can be useful for excluding large folders that are not relevant to the support case or for excluding folders that contain sensitive information. Example configuration:
```xml
<key>ExcludedLogFolders</key>
<array>
    <string>/Library/Logs/Microsoft/mdatp</string>
</array>
```

## [2.2.1] - 2025-02-26
### Fixed
- Even if `SoftwareUpdates` or `PendingAppUpdates` were hidden, the badge would still be displayed in the tray menu and dock. This has been fixed by checking if the widget is hidden before displaying the badge.

### Added
- A new option to set a custom branding tray menu icon by specifying a base64 string of the icon using `TrayMenuBrandingIcon`. Note that the icon should be a monochrome icon to fit the design of the tray menu.


### Changed
- Additional options to the rendering of brand logos has been added that allows for a higher quality rendering of the logo as it in some cases could look blurry or jagged.

## [2.2.0] - 2025-01-07
### Changed
- A slight background has been added increasing visaibility of the text.
- Main window is now slightly resizeable to allow for window to be resized to a smaller size.
- Last reboot time is now monitored and updated every 5 minutes. Displaying in minutes, hours or days depending on the time since last reboot.
- Battery temperature will adapt to the configured measurement system in macOS and show temp in either Celsius or Fahrenheit.
- Storage API has been changed for a more accurate reading of actual storage used.
- "Is Admin" will now display "yes" or "no" localized instead of enabled or disabled.
- In addition to only checking if Company Portal exists when dynamically setting the `Mode` to use, the server url will now also be checked. If the server url contains "i.manage.microsoft.com", the MDM will be set to Intune. This is because Company Portal can validly exist on a device without the device being managed by Intune.
- Button labels on actions can now be set to a custom value. This allows for admins to set custom labels for actions that are displayed in the `Self Service` page. Example configuration:
```xml
<dict>
    <key>Command</key>
    <string>open https://github.com/macadmins/supportcompanion</string>
    <key>Description</key>
    <string/>
    <key>Icon</key>
    <string>heart.fill</string>
    <key>Name</key>
    <string>Open Intranet</string>
    <key>ButtonLabel</key>
    <string>Open</string>
</dict>
```

### Fixed
- Artifacts were being left behind on the desktop window when IP address was updated.

### Added
- The configured logo will now be displayed in the tray menu as well. Can be hidden by setting `ShowLogoInTrayMenu` to `false` in the configuration.
- A new option to show the desktop information window "frosted". This allows for a frosted glass effect on the desktop information window. Example configuration:
```xml
<key>DesktopInfoBackgroundFrosted</key>
<true/>
```
- A new option to show a custom view in the navigation bar based on a Markdown file. This allows for creating a custom view with custom information relevant to your organization. Example configuration:
```xml
<key>MarkdownFilePath</key>
<string>/path/to/custom/view.md</string>
<key>MarkdownMenuLabel</key>
<string>Custom View</string>
<key>MarkdownMenuIcon</key>
<string>doc.text</string>
```
- A new option to show custom cards in the navigation bar. This allows for displaying large numbers of cards without cluttering the home view, by moving them to their own view. Example configuration:
```xml
<key>CustomCardsMenuLabel</key>
<string>Custom Cards</string>
<key>CustomCardsMenuIcon</key>
<string>doc.text</string>
<key>CustomCardPath</key>
<string>/path/to/custom/cards.json</string>
```
- A new option to trigger actions using the CLI. This allows for triggering actions using the CLI instead of the UI. This can be useful for automating actions or triggering actions from a script. By default, actions configured as privileged will require authentication. This can be disabled by setting `RequirePrivilegedActionAuthentication` to `false`. Example usage:
```bash
/Applications/SupportCompanion.app/Contents/Resources/SupportCompanionCLI action "Restart clipboard"
```
- Additional arguments to the CLI to allow for getting additional information that is displayed in the app. Example usage:
```bash
/Applications/SupportCompanion.app/Contents/Resources/SupportCompanionCLI battery
```
Example output:
```plaintext
üîã Battery Information
-----------------------
Health:          93% üîã
Cycle Count:     37
Temperature:     36.7¬∞C üå°Ô∏è
Charging Status: Not Charging
Time Remaining:  N/A
```
- A new feature that allows for user elevation of standard users to admin users. This feature is useful for instances where a user needs to perform an action that requires admin rights. The user can request elevation by clicking the `Elevate` button in the tray menu or Identity menu. The admin can configure wether a reason is required, how long the reason must be and if the reason should be sent via a webhook to a specified URL or saved to disk. Example configuration:
```xml
<key>EnableElevation</key>
<true/>
<key>RequireResonForElevation</key>
<true/>
<key>ReasonMinLength</key>
<integer>20</integer>
<key>MaxElevationTime</key>
<integer>60</integer>
<key>ElevationWebhookUrl</key>
<string>https://webhook.url</string>
<key>ShowElevateTrayCard</key>
<true/>
<key>ElevationSeverity</key>
<integer>6</integer>
```

Example of JSON payload sent to webhook:
```json
{
  "severity" : 6,
  "date" : "2024-12-16T11:21:01Z",
  "host" : "Tobias's MacBook",
  "user" : "tobias",
  "serial" : "H123456789",
  "reason" : "Awesome dev stuff"
}
```

## [2.1.0] - 2024-12-11
### Changed
- The tray menu has been changed to a custom menu that is an extension of the apps main UI. This allows for a more consistent look and feel between the tray menu and the main app. The tray menu now displays the same information as the main app, including device information, storage information and patching progress as well as actions. If you have custom actions configured using `Actions`, the first 6 actions will be displayed in the tray menu. If you have more than 6 actions, the rest can be run from the Self Service section in the main app.
- If the app is launched using the URL scheme `supportcompanion://`, the tray menu will not be displayed.
- Shadow for green text has been removed as it could make the text look blurry. Instead the green has been changed to a darker shade to make it more readable.
- Copy device info button will now include additional information about the device, including battery and storage. Example output:
```plaintext

### Changed
- Added a softer shade of orange and red when light mode is enabled to improve visibility and readability.
- If launching the app using a URL scheme, the app will now exit **only** when `supportcompanion://` is used. This allows for the app to be started using a URL scheme and remain open when using `supportcompanion://home` or similar. Example:

```bash
open supportcompanion://
```

Will remain open when the window is closed:
```bash

This mode is useful for admins who want to see what applications are installed on the device and their version numbers. To enable this mode, set `SystemProfilerApps` to `true` in the configuration. Example configuration:
```xml
<key>SystemProfilerApps</key>
<true/>
```
- A new page called `Self Service` that will display all actions configured by an admin in the mobileconfig using the `Actions` array. This allows for easy access to self-service actions that the user can perform on their device. If no actions are configured, the page will not be displayed.
- A new key for configuring an icon for actions that will be displayed in the `Self Service` page. This allows for admins to configure an icon for each action that is displayed in the `Self Service` page. The icon should be a material icon name from https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/. For example `apple-finder` would be `AppleFinder`. Example configuration:
```xml
<key>Actions</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>Name</key>
        <string>Restart clipboard</string>

This is done by using a JSON file populated any way the admin sees fit. To add custom widgets, add the below key to the mobileconfig and configure a JSON like the below example
  - The `icon` key should be a material icon name from https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/. For example `apple-finder` would be `AppleFinder`
```xml
<key>CustomWidgetsPath</key>
<string>/path/to/custom/widgets.json</string>
```
```json
[
  {
    "icon": "Laptop",
    "header": "Custom Widget",

## [1.0.4] - 2024-05-31
### Added
- Localized the app to `Swedish` and `French`. The app will now display in the user's preferred language if it is set to one of these languages in macOS.
