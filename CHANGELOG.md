and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.1.0] - 2024-12-09
### Changed
- The tray menu has been changed to a custom menu that is an extension of the apps main UI. This allows for a more consistent look and feel between the tray menu and the main app. The tray menu now displays the same information as the main app, including device information, storage information and patching progress as well as actions. If you have custom actions configured using `Actions`, the first 6 actions will be displayed in the tray menu. If you have more than 6 actions, the rest can be run from the Self Service section in the main app.
- If the app is launched using the URL scheme `supportcompanion://`, the tray menu will not be displayed.
- Shadow for green text has been removed as it could make the text look blurry. Instead the green has been changed to a darker shade to make it more readable.
- Copy device info button will now include additional information about the device, including battery and storage. Example output:
```plaintext

### Added
- Support for Japansese localization, thanks @kenchan0130 for the Japanese localization
- A badge to the tray menu icon that visually indicates that the user has pending updates to install.

## [2.0.2] - 2024-12-06
### Changed
- Added a softer shade of orange and red when light mode is enabled to improve visibility and readability.
- If launching the app using a URL scheme, the app will now exit **only** when `supportcompanion://` is used. This allows for the app to be started using a URL scheme and remain open when using `supportcompanion://home` or similar. Example:

Will exit when the window is closed:
```bash
open supportcompanion://
```

Will remain open when the window is closed:
```bash
open supportcompanion://home
```

### Added
- Option to hide Categories and Dividers on the Desktop Info view. This allows for a cleaner and more focused view of the information displayed. Example configuration:
```xml
<key>DesktopInfoHideItems</key>
<array>
    <string>Category</string>
    <string>Divider</string>
</array>
```

  ```
  For additional migration information, refer to the [migration guide](https://github.com/macadmins/SupportCompanion/wiki/Migrating-from-version-1.X-to-2.0).

## [1.4.0] - 2024-11-06

### Fixed
- When a app or system update notification was clicked, the command was not run resulting in nothing happening.
- ToolTips were not being shown.

## [1.3.0] - 2024-09-19
### Added
- A new mode for the app called `SystemProfilerApps` which allows for the app to display applications installed under `/Applications` and their version numbers as well as Architecture. This mode is useful for admins who want to see what applications are installed on the device and their version numbers. To enable this mode, set `SystemProfilerApps` to `true` in the configuration. Example configuration:
```xml
<key>SystemProfilerApps</key>
<true/>
```
- A new page called `Self Service` that will display all actions configured by an admin in the mobileconfig using the `Actions` array. This allows for easy access to self-service actions that the user can perform on their device. If no actions are configured, the page will not be displayed.
- A new key for configuring an icon for actions that will be displayed in the `Self Service` page. This allows for admins to configure an icon for each action that is displayed in the `Self Service` page. The icon should be a material icon name from https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/. For example `apple-finder` would be `AppleFinder`. Example configuration:
```xml
<key>Actions</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>Name</key>
        <string>Restart clipboard</string>
        <key>Command</key>
        <string>killall pboard</string>
        <key>Icon</key>
        <string>AppleFinder</string>
    </dict>
```
### Changed
- If a widget is configured to not be shown or otherwise should not be shown, the widget will now be blanked out instead of being hidden. This is to ensure that the layout of the widgets is consistent and that the user knows that the widget is not available.

## [1.2.0] - 2024-09-04
### Added
- German localization, thanks @motodotsh for the German localization
- A new suite package that contains the main app and the LaunchAgent package. This allows for admins to install both the main app and the LaunchAgent using a single package
- A new option to use custom widgets on the Home view of the app. This allows for admins to add custom widgets to the Home view of the app to display information that is relevant to the user. This is done by using a JSON file populated any way the admin sees fit. To add custom widgets, add the below key to the mobileconfig and configure a JSON like the below example
  - The `icon` key should be a material icon name from https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/. For example `apple-finder` would be `AppleFinder`
```xml
<key>CustomWidgetsPath</key>
<string>/path/to/custom/widgets.json</string>
```
```json
[
  {
    "icon": "Laptop",
    "header": "Custom Widget",
    "data": {
      "Custom Label1": "A long example of a custom value with word wrap",
      "Custom Label2": "Custom Value2"
    }
  }
]
```

### Changed

- A new feature to show information about the device and support contact information on the desktop background. This allows for admins to show information about the device and support contact information on the desktop background. The information is displayed in any corner of the desktop background and can be customized using the configuration. Example configuration:
```xml
<key>ShowDesktopInfo</key>
<true/>
<key>DesktopInfoFontSize</key>
<integer>19</integer>
<key>DesktopInfoLevel</key>
<string>Custom</string>

### Added
- Added a new configuration to disable the menu toggle button in the app. This allows for admins to disable the menu toggle button if they want to prevent users from hiding the menu. Example configuration: https://github.com/macadmins/SupportCompanion/issues/38

```
- Norwegian localization, thanks @johnhans for the Norwegian localization
### Changed
- Margins around `BrandLogo` has been increased to make it look better in the side menu

## [1.0.4] - 2024-05-31
### Added
- Localized the app to `Swedish` and `French`. The app will now display in the user's preferred language if it is set to one of these languages in macOS.

Thank you, @hachirotahoshino, for the French localization https://github.com/macadmins/SupportCompanion/issues/31
- New configuration key to allow for adding a company logo to the side menu of the app. This allows for admins to add their company logo to the app to make it more personalized. Example configuration:

  - As it is a link, the color of the email address has been changed to blue to indicate that it is clickable
### Fixed

- Email address in the support info dialog did not display the entire email address if it was too long. This has been fixed by adding a word wrap https://github.com/macadmins/SupportCompanion/issues/29

## [1.0.3] - 2024-05-28
### Fixed
